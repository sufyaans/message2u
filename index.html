        <h2 class="card-title">Shit hit the fan</h2>
        <p class="card-content">That Thursday we met when I was in your room and we were sitting nose to nose. That connection that came between us was completely unexpected (kinda), yet so incredibly amazing. It opened my eyes brought feelings that I never knew I had. That night when I held you and hugged you it just felt right and I didn't want to let go (Even though I was seeing you the next morning).</p>
